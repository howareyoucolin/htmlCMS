list_circle_a_list_title_1 = Foot Massage

list_circle_a_content_1 = Foot reflexology is “pressure therapy” and involves applying focused pressure to certain known reflex points located in the foot to cure or prevent disease. Foot reflexology is based on the premise that our nerve zones or reflex points go from the bottom of our feet to the top of our head, encompassing all vital organs on the way. A trained reflexologist can put pressure on different meridiens or energy lines on the sole and side of the feet to determine the cause of illness.

list_circle_a_list_title_2 = Pedicures

list_circle_a_content_2 = A pedicure is a cosmetic treatment of the feet and toenails, analogous to a manicure. Pedicures are done for cosmetic, therapeutic, and medical purposes and can help prevent nail diseases and nail disorders[citation needed]. They are popular throughout the world, especially among women.<br/>Pedicures include care not only for toenails; dead skin cells are rubbed off the bottom of the feet, using a rough stone (often a pumice stone) or other material. Skin care is often provided up to the knee, including granular exfoliation, moisturizing, and massage.

list_circle_a_list_title_3 = Manicure

list_circle_a_content_3 = A manicure is a cosmetic beauty treatment for the fingernails and hands, performed at home or in a nail salon. A manicure consists of filing and shaping of the free edge, pushing (with a cuticle pusher) and clipping (with cuticle nippers) any nonliving tissue (limited to cuticle and hangnails), treatments, massage of the hand, and the application of fingernail polish. <br/>Some manicures can include the painting of pictures or designs on the nails, or applying small decals or imitation jewels.

list_circle_a_list_title_4 = Facial

list_circle_a_content_4 = There are different kinds of masks (e.g. cactus, cucumber, etc.) for different purposes: deep-cleansing, by penetrating the pores; healing acne scars or hyper-pigmentation; brightening, for a gradual illumination of the skin tone. Some masks are designed to dry or solidify on the face, almost like plaster; others just remain wet. The perceived effects of a facial mask treatment include revitalizing, healing, or refreshing; and, may yield temporary or long-term benefits (depending on environmental, dietary, and other skincare factors).

blog_title_2 = Fingernails Predict Your Health

blog_content_2 = I'm a girl and I work in a nail salon in Manhattan, New York. Today I read an article from the internet so I now am sharing it with you guys:<br/><br/>Other than manicurists, most people don’t spend a lot of time thinking about fingernails. But did you know that they can tell you if you have a disease? <br/><br/><img src="https://www.uvnailspa.com/uploads/reg/14943103496314901557876814nails.jpg?1494310349902" /><br/><br/>Just for a moment, take a good look at your fingernails. If you have polish on your nails, take it off and give those nails a breather for a while. our nails should be smooth and should have a lighter half circle where the nail starts growing from. That little area is called the “lunula,” Latin for “little moon.” Your skin should overlap the nail where it grows from and it should abut it on the sides. Your fingernails ideally should be kept short, overlapping the skin by about a millimeter. <br/><br/>But fashion often trumps good health decisions, and many women (and a few men) place polish on their nails. While that polish isn’t particularly healthy for your body, we’ll save that discussion for another blog. Importantly, the polish hides an important window into the health of your body.<br/><br/>All sorts of illnesses can make your fingernails look funny. Psoriasis and fungal infections are the most common problems with nails, causing them to grow thick and crack. But it’s those lines that cross the nail, not run with the length of it, that are of real concern. These lines (called Beau’s lines), start at the lunula and grow out with the nail. They can occur with syphilis, diabetes, heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, zinc deficiency, and after high fevers or after chemotherapy. And nails can become spoon-like with iron deficiency anemia, and the ends of the fingers can grow into clubs with lung and heart disease, cirrhosis and thyroid disease. Yellow nails can mean you have certain lung diseases or even AIDS. And the prettiest nails, called “Terry’s nails” can mean you have diabetes, cirrhosis or heart failure. These nails are white or light pink and have a narrow normal pink band near the end of the fingernail.<br/><br/>And there are a lot of other diseases that change your nails. But now that you’re worried, what about those long ridges that so many people get? Relax. They're normal. And the dark bands in African American fingernails? Also normal.<br/><br/>So take a good look at your nails. If they look a little funny, visit your doctor.

blog_title_3 = UV Nail Spa Tips: Coconut Oil for Your Nails

blog_content_3 = Which woman doesn't want beautiful nails? Unfortunately, the combination of harsh environmental conditions, improper diet, and daily chores can make your nails look dull and lifeless. While your nails are made up of keratin, they contain high water content, which makes nails flexible and soft. A little shortage of water will affect your nails greatly, making them look dry and rough.<br/><br/>Using coconut oil will ensure that your nails don't lose excessive water and continue to look great, and that's mainly because of the nutrients available in this oil. These nutrients will strengthen your nails and cuticles and add shine to your nails as well.<br/><br/><img src="https://www.uvnailspa.com/uploads/reg/1494310485984214901553297622aaaaaaaaaaaaa.jpg?1494310486567" /><br/><br/><h3>6 Benefits of Coconut Oil for Nails</h3><br/>There is actually a long list of benefits of coconut oil for nails, but here are some of the best reasons why you should make use of coconut oil. Below are 6 adorable benefits for nails you can enjoy from coconut oil, and how you can apply the coconut oil for specific purpose.<br/><br/><h3>1. It Treats Nail Fungus</h3><br/>Using coconut oil regularly will protect your nail from fungal infections. It contains antifungal acids that not only eliminate any nail fungus, but also moisturizes your skin and equip the nails with certain nutrients.<br/><br/>What you need: Get some extra virgin coconut oil, which you can buy from health foods stores. Also, get some oregano oil – make sure to use oil only because the capsules aren't going to help.<br/><br/>UV Nail Spa Salon teaches you how to apply: Mix 1 part of oregano oil to 5 parts of coconut oil. Use this ointment on your nails and massage gently. Be sure to use it on the areas where the nail meets your skin. You need to dilute oregano oil if you experience any burning sensation when applying it to your skin. Leave it on for several minutes until your skin absorbs the oil completely. Do it twice a day for a couple of weeks to see effects.<br/><br/><h3>2. It Helps with Nail Growth</h3><br/>Using coconut oil is a great way to help with nail growth because it contains all the nutrients required to keep your nails moisturized. It also strengthens your cuticles and cures hangnails.<br/><br/>What you need: 1/4 cup of organic coconut oil, 4 drops of rosemary oil, and 1/4 cup of honey.<br/><br/>How to apply: Mix all ingredients together and put it in microwave for 20 seconds. Once warmed up, you need to soak your nails in this solution for 15 minutes. Do it at least once a week for stronger, healthier nails.<br/><br/><h3>3. It Moisturizes Cuticle</h3><br/>Coconut oil for nails is a perfect choice not only because it cures infections but also because it helps keep your cuticle moisturized, which plays a big role in helping you have shinier, stronger, and healthier nails. It serves as a perfect remedy for ragged cuticles. Its emollient nature will help prevent your nails from becoming brittle.<br/><br/>What you need: Coconut Oil<br/><br/>How to apply: Just take a small amount of coconut oil and apply it directly on your ragged cuticles. Massage your cuticles gently and that's it. Doing this regularly will fix ragged, rough cuticles and even help soothe torn cuticles and painful hangnails.<br/><br/><h3>4. It Prevents Hangnail</h3><br/>If your nails are constantly exposed to water, you will have to deal with painful hangnails at some time. A bad manicure may also result in hangnail. It is basically a small extra bit of your skin that you see coming out from the cuticles of your nails. This opening can provide bacteria or fungus with a chance to enter your skin and spread infection. Coconut oil will help resolve the issue in no time.<br/><br/>What you need: Coconut oil<br/><br/>How to apply: Simply take some coconut oil and apply it on your cuticles. Be sure to massage your cuticles gently. Doing this regularly will strengthen the cuticle region of your nails and prevent hangnails.<br/><br/><h3>5. It Cures the Ridges</h3><br/>You will end up developing ridges on your nails when there isn't enough moisture in your nails. Coconut oil helps because it has microbial properties that will go a long way in preventing and eliminating these ridges.<br/><br/>What you need: Coconut oil<br/><br/>How to apply: Take some coconut oil and use it to massage your nails daily. Making this a routine will help you have strong, shiny, flawless nails.<br/><br/><h3>6. It Cures Athlete's Foot</h3><br/>Dealing with athlete's foot can be a painful experience. You don't have to deal with the pain anymore because coconut oil will make things right in no time.<br/><br/>What you need: Coconut oil<br/><br/>How to apply: Start by washing your feet. Now, use a towel to dry your feet properly. Warm up some coconut oil and use it to massage your nails for 3 to 5 times a day.

blog_title_4 = What Colors Look Good Together With Pink Nails

blog_content_4 = A quick tip by a nail salon. Manicures and pedicures have become the latest accessory in many ways, furnishing a stylish counterpoint to any number of outfits. With the ability to add an instant dose of glamour, sophistication or edge to a look, manicures make a major impact -- and as such, should be considered when grappling with what clothing to wear on any given day. Bold and bright manis utilizing vivid hues are all the rage, so opt for clothing that complements a common and stunning shade like pink.<br/><br/><img src="https://www.uvnailspa.com/uploads/reg/149431065299511490656851550qq图片20170327192030.png?1494310652937" /><br/><br/><h3>Neutrals</h3><br/>Neutrals are a wonderful way to go when choosing the perfect outfit to complement an adorable pink manicure. Monochromatic looks are not only a stylish choice, but they allow the beauty of a manicure to pop.Try a beige sheath dress, ivory pencil skirt or a camel-colored trench coat to create a stunning ensemble that meshes perfectly with a feminine nail color like pink. A comfortable and casual black cotton maxi dress look fabulous with a cool fedora and bright pink nails. For glam nights out, pair black leather leggings with a black blouse and gold jewelry to give your mani a chance of taking center stage.<br/><br/><h3>Orange</h3><br/>A bold, vivid hue like orange is an on-trend choice to pair with pink when done properly. Brights like fuchsia and orange look striking together, and are commonly seen on spring runways as designers are prone to combine these two saturated hues. A pair of faded denim jeans and high heels is a playful look when combined with a silky orange blazer or blouse and your statement nails. An orange jumpsuit, while flashy, is a glamorous choice when dressing with your pink mani in mind.<br/><br/><h3>Black & White</h3><br/>The classic combination of black and white pairs wonderfully with pops of bright color, so opt for garments in this color palette to let your pink mani really shine. Sport a white silk camisole with a pair of black high-waisted trousers for a sleek ensemble sure to earn major style points. A white cotton sundress has the same impact. Pair a black and white outfit with a pink lip and matching nails for a look that's perfectly appropriate for tons of occasions.<br/><br/><h3>Turquoise</h3><br/>A combination of turquoise and pink is a refreshing twist on cool color blocking. Pair a turquoise dress with a bright pink manicure for a fresh summer or spring outfit. Gorgeous turquoise bracelets or statement cocktail ring will look fabulous when paired with pink nails, while a turquoise sequined camisole with white jeans is a chic ensemble to try as well. If the occasion calls for glamorous attire, a turquoise silk gown with a fuchsia manicure is a stunning way to make a style statement.

blog_title_5 = A Guide To Proper Nail Care for MEN

blog_content_5 = First, i would like to note that if it's manly enough for Tyler Durden, it's probably manly enough for you.<br/>Second, I would like to say that if your beliefs may lead you to think that getting or giving yourself a manicure is 'unmanly,' you may be right. it's not manly in the 'live off the land and rassle with bears' sense, but it IS, in my opinion, gentlemanly. A gentleman does not get haircuts, shaves, pressed suits, and shined shoes, only to offer an bear claw to shake when meeting a stranger. Even men with finger-taxing occupations like mechanics and carpenters can't afford to allow their fingernails to grow unchecked forever. Hence, i have decided to provide a how-to guide for all the grizzlies out there.<br/><br/>This might be a touchy topic at first glance because for most men nail care starts and ends with the occasional cutting of the nails when they grow too big to be left alone in the wild. Besides, in some societies and social circles men who take care of their appearance in general and their nails and skin in particular are regarded as being feminine. But as a matter of fact, as cooking can be regarded as simply a survival skill, cutting your nails and maintaining them in good shape can be regarded as basic personal hygiene and maintaining one's hygiene can hardly be a reason to laugh at somebody.<br/>Men's nails grow faster than women's. Also, they are larger and thicker. This is how nature sees it appropriate. But the fact that men's nails grow faster and are larger, means that they also are prone to more bumps and bangs. Add to this the fact that generally men more often have jobs that involve physical labor, which makes their hands and nails dirty, and you will see why washing your hands once a week is not enough if you are to maintain a decent level of personal hygiene.<br/>If you are still not convinced that being a men does not suppose poor nail and skin care, consider the fact that many male Hollywood stars, including famous action movies heroes, do take care of their skin and nails. Additionally, women are often repulsed by man with dirty hands, so unless you live in a very primitive society, where dirty hands and broken nails is the standard, some nail care is never too much. Besides, in many societies, having clean hands with delicate skin and nails is desirable by many men as well because it says that their owner is a white [collar], not a blue collar worker.<br/><br/>WITH THAT SAID....<br/><br/>Tools you will need:<br/>Bowl of Hot, Soapy Water (i use a teaspoon of bleach in the water also)<br/>Cuticle Pusher (pointy stick)<br/>Nail Trimmers<br/>Emery Board<br/><br/>Personally, I feel that while the act of grooming one's nails is perfectly natural, i don't wish to do it in full view of my wife and son. I am not ashamed to take care of my nails, but it's one of those things that's better to never notice. most people will give little regard for men's 'pretty' nails, but will recoil in disgust at gross, long, or dirty nails. I like to keep them done without ever seeming like i put effort into them. Such is the way of a gentleman.<br/><br/>1. In order to soften the dirt under the nails, and to make the cuticles pliable, soak one hand in the bowl of soapy water, that has been heated to a barely tolerable temperature. A teaspoon of bleach in the bowl will remove any pigment contained in dirt grit or grime that is under your fingernails, and increase the margin of error when you scrape out said crud. even if you miss some, you wont be able to see it. Allow 5-10 minutes to soak, otherwise the skin will not be soft enough to work with.<br/><br/>2. Use the Cuticle pusher to push back the tissue any place where nail meets skin. Take care to not push back too hard, or you will have irritated nail beds that will drive you absolutely batty. While doing so, utilize the opportunity to remove any debris that has accumulated in this area. When complete, inspect the beds. they should look uniform, neat, and slightly rounded. Most Cuticle Pushers have a second tip, used for cleaning under the fingernail. Flip the CP over and utilize this end, but do so CAREFULLY. Being too brazen can damage the skin that keeps your nail firmly attached to your finger (called the 'quick', which is the subject of the phrase, "cut me to the quick"...cutting or damaging the quick is painful and lasts for days. Needless to say, this is best avoided.).<br/><br/>3. Next, use the nail trimmers to get rid of excess length. Less is more here, as cutting them too long is easily remedied by merely cutting again or filing, though cutting too short can only be fixed with time, and will hurt until they repair themselves. An easy method for knowing how long they should be is to cut approximately 1/8th of an inch shorter than the end of the fingertip. remember, we will be taking the nails shorter with the emery board in mere minutes, so when in doubt, leave it a little long.<br/><br/>4. We're rounding third base now, and heading home. Grab a hold of your emery board, flip it to the side with the rougher grain and shape your nails as desired. they should look rounded and neat, almost a reflection of the angle of your nail bed. Most men should be familiar with sanding wood, if only from shop class, and the same rules apply. Filing, like sanding, can be overdone. there is a time where one more brush stroke will ruin the painting, and if you feel you can only get your nails to 'good enough', then leave it be or the next time you try to scratch your back you'll be doing so with nubs. When complete, switch to the finer grit and buff out any jagged spots. this fine side is not for removal of length, but rather for touching up what you removed with the tough side.<br/><br/>5. Repeat on other hand, unless you dig the asymmetrical look. I personally can't pull that off :)<br/><br/>OK, now allow me to kill some unmanly myths about going to a nail spa salon.<br/><br/>1. It is not unmanly to pride yourself on proper grooming. it IS unmanly to have it done by another man, or during a mud bath.<br/>2. If you dislike doing it yourself, by all means ask (or tell...*grunt*) your wife or girlfriend, to do it for you. being pampered by a woman is one of life's little joys, so if you have any objections to doing your nails, by all means, feel free to indulge. This statement applies to eyebrows too.<br/>3. This act is NEVER to be referred to as a 'manicure', and especially, not as a 'mani'. have some self respect, manly man!<br/>4. Toenail care is not as involved. By all means, just clip and scrape, and feel free to skip the lavender foot bath and emery board. Flip Flops are for Hippies and Jesus, so please oh PLEASE put some socks on.<br/>5. It has a name. It's called an emery board. not a 'nail file'.<br/>6. There is not now, nor has there ever been, an appropriate men's product that is applied to nails via a tiny paintbrush. Nail hardener, strengthener, polish, etc, isn't for you. Just accept it.

With the ability to add an instant dose of glamour, sophistication or edge to a look, manicures make a major impact -- and as such, should be considered when grappling with what clothing to wear on any given day. Bold and bright manis utilizing vivid hues are all the rage, so opt for clothing that complements a common and stunning shade like pink.

Unfortunately, the combination of harsh environmental conditions, improper diet, and daily chores can make your nails look dull and lifeless. While your nails are made up of keratin, they contain high water content, which makes nails flexible and soft. A little shortage of water will affect your nails greatly, making them look dry and rough.

arg2_seo_description_article = Just for a moment, take a good look at your fingernails. If you have polish on your nails, take it off and give those nails a breather for a while. our nails should be smooth and should have a lighter half circle where the nail starts growing from. That little area is called the “lunula,” Latin for “little moon.” Your skin should overlap the nail where it grows from and it should abut it on the sides. Your fingernails ideally should be kept short, overlapping the skin by about a millimeter.

Very clean, extremely quiet, unbelievably relaxing,  well lit, extraordinarily good service and remarkably professional nail-tech skills.

Then I past by this nail salon. 29.99 for a combo of manicure and pedicure , what a reasonable price in midtown, Manhattan. I just went in ahead and immediately I noticed how clean and relaxing the salon environment is. Then Lily did the service for me, and I am so glad I had a try. Next time, when I come back to New York, I would for sure come again.

Mani-pedi is 29.99 which is almost unheard of in manhattan particularly on the UES. Maria is the only person i will go to. She does a thorough job and I have no complaints with my nails which by the way last a week. The salon is spacious enough and clean using disposable bags in the pedi tubs so you're not directly putting your feet in the tub. The price the service and the fact that the 2nd Ave subway is on the corner makes it a no brainer!

Good location and it's very easy to reach in that area. I like driving around the town and there are many one-hour parking meters right at the front of the nail salon. That is what interested me to come and try in the first place. And the friendliness of their employees is what keeps returning for more services over the months.<br/>So hope they will keep up the good works. And i gladly recommend it to all of you out there on yelp.

The summer season is quickly approaching, and there are sure to be new releases from all the brands for the best time of year to show off the perfect mani/pedi.  From timeless reds, to new nail tints, this season is bringing back a couple of classics and introducing some funky freshness into the mix.<br/> <br/>1058 Nail & Spa is giving a guide to the 10 hottest nail color trends to rock this summer:<br/><br/>1. Pale Blue- Soft and subtle, yet fun and youthful, pale blues make you feel the happiness of the summer months by just looking at your nails.<br/><br/>2. Tinted Topcoats- The latest in the nail polish world, these sheer, nail perfecting tints are making a big splash for those who love a bare but polished, clean look.<br/><br/>3. Milky White- The winter white trend isn’t going anywhere!  Milky whites give a bright, clean, not chalky, look that will take you through the summer months.<br/><br/>4. Pale “Vintage” Pink- A sweet, girly shade that is a little “dustier” than your typical pink, this color will compliment just about everything in your wardrobe.<br/><br/>5. Cobalt Blue- Blue is sometimes considered a risky color to pull off, but this electric shade will shake things up a bit and looks best if worn on shorter square nails.<br/><br/>6. Coral- This summer classic is back with a vengeance this year.  Try a bright, vivid coral hue for a fun vacation look that is sure to bring the heat.<br/><br/>7. Cherry Red- Always a staple no matter the season, try a traditional cherry red for a sexy, playful, yet sophisticated look all summer long.<br/><br/>8. Neons- Make a bold statement this summer with the popular 80’s colors.  Shocking yellows, pinks and greens make a fun splash on toes while walking in the sand.<br/><br/>9. Dove Grey- For a modern look that is still considered neutral, try a moody gray hue.<br/><br/>10. Iridescent- What was once a color for your grandma is now making a serious comeback thanks to YSL’s iridescent spring shades.  These pearl like colors have an iridescent finish that is surprisingly modern, and when they catch the light they make for some serious magic.
